    ///
    /// Creating page table mappings is a fundamentally unsafe operation because
    /// there are various ways to break memory safety through it. For example,
    /// re-mapping an in-use page to a different frame changes and invalidates
    /// all values stored in that page, resulting in undefined behavior on the
    /// next use.
    ///
    /// The caller must ensure that no undefined behavior or memory safety
    /// violations can occur through the new mapping. Among other things, the
    /// caller must prevent the following:
    ///
    /// - Aliasing of `&mut` references, i.e. two `&mut` references that point to
    ///   the same physical address. This is undefined behavior in Rust.
    ///     - This can be ensured by mapping each page to an individual physical
    ///       frame that is not mapped anywhere else.
    /// - Creating uninitalized or invalid values: Rust requires that all values
    ///   have a correct memory layout. For example, a `bool` must be either a 0
    ///   or a 1 in memory, but not a 3 or 4. An exception is the `MaybeUninit`
    ///   wrapper type, which abstracts over possibly uninitialized memory.
    ///     - This is only a problem when re-mapping pages to different physical
    ///       frames. Mapping a page that is not in use yet is fine.
    ///
    /// Special care must be taken when sharing pages with other address spaces,
    /// e.g. by setting the `GLOBAL` flag. For example, a global mapping must be
    /// the same in all address spaces, otherwise undefined behavior can occur
    /// because of TLB races. It's worth noting that all the above requirements
